# Crypto-Market-Analysis
1. This folder contains data files which are raw and cleaned. 
2. Also, the data file with W indicates weekly distrubted data by taking the average price over the 7 days.
3. The python notebook files are almost same one is for experiment and other one to consolidated what worked.
4. I am putting down some variable meanings here


1️⃣ Market Capitalization (Market Cap)
✅ Formula:
Market Cap = Current Price × Circulating Supply

✅ What It Means:
Represents the total value of a cryptocurrency in circulation.
Indicates the size and dominance of a cryptocurrency in the market.
Large market cap → More stable & less volatile.
Small market cap → Higher risk & higher potential returns.

✅ Example Calculation:
If Bitcoin’s price = $30,000 and circulating supply = 19 million BTC, then:
30,000×19,000,000=570,000,000,000
Market Cap = $570 billion.

✅ How It Helps in Analysis:
Used to classify cryptocurrencies:
Large-cap coins: More stable (Bitcoin, Ethereum).
Mid-cap coins: Moderate risk & potential (Solana, Avalanche).
Small-cap coins: High volatility (Meme coins, new tokens).
Helps compare cryptocurrencies to determine dominance.


2️⃣ Total Volume
✅ Formula:
Total Volume=Total Coins Traded×Price

✅ What It Means:
Measures how much of a cryptocurrency has been traded in 24 hours.
Higher volume = More liquidity (easier to buy/sell).
Lower volume = Less activity (risk of price manipulation).

✅ Example Calculation:
If Ethereum’s price = $2,000 and 24-hour trading volume = 5 million ETH, then:
5,000,000×2,000=10,000,000,000
Total Volume = $10 billion traded in 24 hours.

✅ How It Helps in Analysis:
A spike in volume could signal big market moves (buying/selling pressure).
Low volume coins are easier to manipulate (whales can move the market).
Price without volume means nothing—it could be artificially inflated.
